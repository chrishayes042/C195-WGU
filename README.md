# C195 Application
The purpose of this application is to teach the creator how to design an application that utilizes a MSSQL database.
To do this, I created a Java GUI desktop application that schedules appointments.

# How To Run The Program

Once the program is started, you'll be presented with a login screen. Login using your credentials, if anything is incorrect you'll not be able to log in.  
Once logged in you'll be presented with the main screen in which you can choose what you want to see.    
To add a Customer or Appointment - Click on the "Add Customer" or "Add Appointment" button, this will open a new screen where you can type the information in to be added.  
To update, go to the Customer or Appointments screen - Click on the customer / appointment in the table that you want to update, the text fields will populate, change the information in the text fields and click the update button.  
To Delete, go to the Customer or Appointments screen - Click on the customer / appointment in the table that you want to delete, and click the delete button.

# Additional Report
For the additional report I chose to show the user all of the customer names, appointment location and the customer address.   
To do this, I created a SQL query that joins the appointment table with the customer table.
